# This tool was patched since we need to solve hcap's on dms from now on and im too lazy (and retarded) to fix this shit
### I wont archive this repo so you guys might open a pull request
### Thank you for the great time you can still contact me at [guilded.gg/karma](https://guilded.gg/karma)
#### I might get back to coding but this time it will be something useful or something fun
## Cheers

---------------------------------------
  
### To Do:
  
* [x] Add a rich table giving us detailed information
* [ ] uploading Files (almost done)
* [ ] Add delay rotating so it's not always the same speed
* [x] Remember fingerprint, superproperty, etc. for each token so its becomes less suspicious
* [x] Make the functions seperated like in my old Karuma script or [DMDGO](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/discord-mass-DM-GO) (Vanshaj is a pro, you should go and check his repo out)
* [ ] Make it multi-threaded
* [ ] Add typing [OPTIONAL FEATURE]
* [ ] Fix joining servers issue!?
* [ ] Add offline scraper
* [ ] Add reaction scraper
* [ ] Log the actions in txt files
* [ ] Add a guide for the retarded people
* [ ] Add a name and pfp and about me changer
* [ ] Add a name and pfp and about me scraper
* [ ] Check if message lenght is okay
* [ ] Add a DMs limit and a DMs each token limit [OPTIONAL FEATURE]
* [ ] Avoid already dmed users (like when you dm multiple servers but the member has already been dmed from a previous server)
* [ ] Wave to the member via the wumpus sticker [OPTIONAL FEATURE]
